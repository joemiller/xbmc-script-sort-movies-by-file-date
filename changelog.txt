[B]Version 2.1[/B]
- fixed github issue/2.
- fixed bug where mac osx would sort by ctime (like windows) instead of mtime 
  (like linux/unix)
- fallback in case platform cannot be detected is now to use mtime (linux/unix),
  since most unknown systems are more likely to follow linux semantics than windows

[B]Version 2.0[/B]
- major changes, thanks to https://github.com/Saviq. Thanks Saviq!!
- name changed to script.sort-media
- progress bar added
- sort criteria switchable between mtime and ctime
- now supports sorting TV-Shows and Music-Video libraries too

[B]Version 1.1[/B]
- change name to script.sortmoviesbyfiledate
- replace remaining print() with xbmc.log()
- use strPath + strFileName instead of only strPath
